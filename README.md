## 🚀 About rocket-sim

rocket-sim is a flight simulator that models multi-stage rockets with six degrees of freedom (6DOF). It includes guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, realistic orbital mechanics, and real-time visualization. The software is written in Rust to provide reliability and performance.

This application helps users explore rocket flight dynamics without requiring programming skills. Whether you want to test rocket designs, observe orbital paths, or visualize accurate physics, rocket-sim offers a practical experience on your computer.

## 💻 System Requirements

To run rocket-sim smoothly, make sure your system meets these minimum requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a recent Linux distribution (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Processor: Dual-core CPU at 2.0 GHz or better
- Memory: 4 GB RAM minimum; 8 GB recommended for best performance
- Graphics: Any graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3 or newer
- Storage: At least 200 MB of free disk space

No internet connection is required after installation. The application runs locally on your computer.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started with rocket-sim, follow these steps carefully.

### Step 1: Visit the Download Page

Click the link below to open the releases page where you can download the latest version:

[Download rocket-sim releases](https://github.com/dylan42000/rocket-sim/releases)

On this page, look for the most recent release. The files will typically include executable programs for supported platforms.

### Step 2: Choose Your Version

Find the file that matches your computer system:

- Windows users: Look for a `.exe` file
- macOS users: Look for a `.dmg` or `.zip` file
- Linux users: You may find binaries or `.tar.gz` archives

Download the appropriate file by clicking its link.

### Step 3: Run the Installer or Program

- Windows: Double-click the `.exe` file. Follow any on-screen prompts to install or launch the program.
- macOS: If you downloaded a `.dmg`, open it and drag the rocket-sim app to your Applications folder. Then open the app.
- Linux: Extract the archive if needed and run the executable file inside.

If your system warns you about unknown software, you may need to allow the app in your system security settings. This is normal for apps not downloaded from an official app store.

### Step 4: Start rocket-sim

After installation, open rocket-sim from your desktop or applications menu. The simulator window will appear, ready for setup.
